Benthic d18O records from the LR04 stack [Lisiecki & Raymo, 2005] on
the LR04 age model. Each file has 3 columns: depth, age, and benthic
d18O (with species corrections). Please cite the original sources for
the benthic d18O data as listed in Lisiecki and Raymo [2005]. If you
use the age models provided, please additionally cite Lisiecki &
Raymo, 2005].

NOTE: These cores have been aligned using the automated alignment
algorithm Match [Lisiecki and Lisiecki, 2002] for purposes of
stacking. Alignments have not been cross checked against all available
age control data. Age estimates could contain errors, particularly
before 3 Myr ago.

Age estimates for ODP 665, ODP 704, ODP 928, ODP 1092, and ODP 1148
are not included because they are particularly subject to uncertainty
due to low resolution and/or discontinuous d18O data.
